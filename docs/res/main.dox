@section intro Introduction

DragonEngine is a C++, open-source, code-first, cross-platform, 3D Vulkan Game engine. It gives simple API calls to do complex things, and without hiding the implementation if you don't like something. It extends to multiple other facets, including XR, CV, program acceleration using OpenCL cores, realtime, accurate physics simulations, virtual camera output, and many others.
