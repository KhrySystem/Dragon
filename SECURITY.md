## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Report it in issues
This is for lower-importance security vulnerabilities, capable of being made public, or even better for us, submitting a PR with a fix yourself.
- Send us an email
The more-critical failures should be sent directly to security@khrysystem.dev. Suggestions are welcome on potential fixes.
